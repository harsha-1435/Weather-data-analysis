# Weather-data-analysis

Weather Data Analysis Project
Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of weather data, aiming to predict weather patterns and trends using Python programming and its powerful data analysis libraries. The project was undertaken by a team from the Department of Artificial Intelligence Engineering at Amrita School of Engineering.

# Objectives
To analyze large weather datasets for accurate weather pattern prediction.

To utilize Python libraries for effective data visualization and pattern recognition.

To preprocess and clean weather data to ensure accuracy and reliability in analysis.

# Technologies and Tools
Programming Language: Python

Data Analysis Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Cufflinks

Operating System: OS library for directory management

#Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains a variety of weather attributes such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and solar radiation. The data spans over a period of time and includes observations from different locations.

#Methodology
Data Collection: Gathered weather data with relevant attributes.

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Identified and handled incorrect, incomplete, irrelevant, and missing data to prepare the dataset for analysis.

Data Analysis: Analyzed the preprocessed data to identify weather patterns and trends.

Data Visualization: Created various visualizations like pie charts, bar graphs, and box plots to represent the data and findings effectively.

#Results
High correlation observed between temperature and other weather attributes, indicating their interdependence.

Significant weather patterns and trends were identified, particularly in the Minas Gerais province.

Fluctuations in average temperatures over the years were analyzed, with notable variations between 2013 and 2016.

#How to Use
